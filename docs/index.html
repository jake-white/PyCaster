<h1>PyCaster Documentation</h1>

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>


<p>To use this program, you will need to install pygame (gaming/drawing engine), which can be found in the lib folder of this project (32/64-bit files were both included).
</p>
<p>If you're not using Python 3.5, you will probably need to download the correct version of it yourself at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame.</p>
<p>Move the .whl file to <b>C:\Wherever\Python35\Scripts</b>.</p>


<p>Then, open a CMD line under that directory and run the command <b>pip3 install filename</b>, where filename is <i>probably</i> <b>pygame-1.9.2a0-cp35-none-win32.whl</b>
 or something similar (remember to install 32/64-bit based on what Python you're running).</p>



<p>As far as this tech demo goes, you can download as zip through GitHub (over on the right-hand side) and run main.py with Python 3.5 or honestly whatever Python 3 version you installed pygame under.
Shouldn't matter too much.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>Level Editing</h3>
<p>PyCaster reads in an image (by default, res/world.png, this is configurable) to use for its 2D map.</p>
<p>The image is parsed at runtime and finds a <b>player tile</b> (where the player starts) and a <b>boss tile</b> (where the boss of the level is located) based on a configurable color of pixel.</p>
<h3>Configuration</h3>
Editable config files are located in /configs.
<h4>gameconfig.txt</h4>
<p>This file controls various game-related settings.</p>
<p>Elements are added using the format <b>element=value</b>.</p>
<p>The following elements currently support direction Python code evaluation (so that the user may input special values such as math.pi, etc.):</p>
angle, FOV
<h4>monsterconfig.txt</h4>
<p>This file controls the possible monsters and bosses that are encounterable in PyCaster</p>
<p>Monsters are added using the format <b>"filename.png", ["monster_name", hp, attack], "monster_type"</b>
<p>There currently exist 2 types of monsters, "normal" and "boss".  Normal monsters are automatically added to the random encounter system and may be fought anywhere
on the map. Boss monsters are automatically added to be encountered when the player hits the <b>boss tile</b>.</p>
