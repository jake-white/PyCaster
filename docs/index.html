<h1>PyCaster Documentation</h1>

<h2>Installation Instructions</h2>


<p>To use this program, you will need to install pygame (gaming/drawing engine), which can be found in the lib folder of this project (32/64-bit files were both included).
</p>
<p>If you're not using Python 3.5, you will probably need to download the correct version of it yourself at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame.</p>
<p>Move the .whl file to <b>C:\Wherever\Python35\Scripts</b>.</p>


<p>Then, open a CMD line under that directory and run the command <b>pip3 install filename</b>, where filename is <i>probably</i> <b>pygame-1.9.2a0-cp35-none-win32.whl</b>
 or something similar (remember to install 32/64-bit based on what Python you're running).</p>



<p>As far as this tech demo goes, you can download as zip through GitHub (over on the right-hand side) and run main.py with Python 3.5 or honestly whatever Python 3 version you installed pygame under.
Shouldn't matter too much.</p>
