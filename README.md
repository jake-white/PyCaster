# PyCaster
This is a raycasting tool that will display 2D coordinate maps in pseudo-3D using raycasting and can be used to create games including custom maps, enemies, music, settings, etc.

It is currently under development for the CSCI 23000 final project.

#Documentation
The PyCaster documentation is available at http://jake-white.github.io/PyCaster/docs/

# Installation Instructions
To use this program, you will need to install pygame (gaming/drawing engine), which can be found in the lib folder of this project (32/64-bit files were both included).  If you're not using Python 3.5, you will probably need to download the correct version of it yourself.

http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame.

Move the .whl file to **C:\Wherever\Python35\Scripts**.

Then, open a CMD line under that directory and run the command **pip3 install filename**, where filename is *probably* **pygame-1.9.2a0-cp35-none-win32.whl** or something similar (remember to install 32/64-bit based on what Python you're running).

As far as this tech demo goes, you can download as zip through GitHub (over on the right-hand side) and run main.py with Python 3.5 or honestly whatever Python 3 version you installed pygame under.  Shouldn't matter too much.
