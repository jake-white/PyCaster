# PyCaster
This is a raycasting tool that will display 2D coordinate maps in pseudo-3D using raycasting.
It is under development for the CSCI 23000 final project.

# Installation Instructions
To install pygame on Python 3.5, you will need to install the pygame wheel file found under lib.
You can find pygame wheel files for other Python versions at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame

Move the .whl to **C:\Wherever\Python35\Scripts**
Then, open a CMD line under that directory and run the command **pip3 install filename**
Where filename is *probably* **pygame-1.9.2a0-cp35-none-win32.whl** or something similar.
