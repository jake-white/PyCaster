# PyCaster
This is a raycasting tool that will display 2D coordinate maps in pseudo-3D using raycasting.
It is under development for the CSCI 23000 final project.

# Installation Instructions
To use this program, you will need to install pygame (gaming/drawing engine) and Pillow (3.x replacement for Python Imaging Library).
These can be found here.  Make sure to download for the correct Python version and 32bit/64bit.

Move the .whl files to **C:\Wherever\Python35\Scripts**.

Then, open a CMD line under that directory and run the command **pip3 install filename**, where filename is *probably* **pygame-1.9.2a0-cp35-none-win32.whl**, **Pillow-3.0.0-cp35-none-win32.whl**  or something similar.  You need to do this for both files.

As far as this tech demo goes, you can download as zip through GitHub (over on the right-hand side) and run main.py with Python 3.5 or honestly whatever Python 3 version you installed pygame/Pillow under.  Shouldn't matter too much.
